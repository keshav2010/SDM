# sdm
student data manager (SDM) written in Java and uses Swing framework for GUI and Java collections framework for handling student related data.
The application currently is capable of storing basic student details such as name, contact number, address etc and at the moment its not capable of storing more useful data such as attendence, fees-payment etc which is quite often searched/required than raw student detail. I'm working on implementing Attendence and Fees Management system without affecting existing program flow.
