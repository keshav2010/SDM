# Student Data Manager
student data manager (SDM) written in Java and uses Swing framework for GUI and Java collections framework for handling student related data.
The application currently is capable of storing basic student details such as name, contact number, address etc and also capable to manage attendance records. 

The code is pretty messed up, would be working on making it more readable whenever i get time to fix this crap
