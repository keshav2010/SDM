# sdm
student data manager (SDM) written in Java and uses Swing framework for GUI and Java collections framework for handling student related data.
The application currently is capable of storing basic student details such as name, contact number, address etc and also capable to manage attendance records. 
At the moment its not capable of storing more useful data(say fees payment) which is quite often searched/required than raw student detail. I'm working on implementing Fees Management system without affecting existing program flow, also working on improving Attendance System.
